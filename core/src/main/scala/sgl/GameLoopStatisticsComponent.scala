    * This is always computed (no option to disable it) as it is unlikely
    * to be making any significant performence difference (a couple additions
    * on each frame). It's simpler architecture-wide to simply have it all
    * the time, although in the future we may want to separate it into a
    * different GameLoopComponent (such as InstrumentedGameLoopComponent) and
    * have the core game loop only used for production. But that does not seem
    * necessary as of today. Note that simply wrapping the statistics collect
    * into an if-then-else guarded by a debug flag is unlikely to help, as checking
    * the condition is probably as expensive as collecting the data (unless the conditions
    * can be removed at compile time).
    *
    * To avoid garbage collection, we use a mutable Statistics object, which
    * means that on each frame the same instance is updated. From a client
    * usage, you cannot store the statistics between frames to do some
    * comparisons.
