/** Provides the platform-specific System object
  *
  * This trait specifies the interface that a platform-specific
  * SystemProvider should implement. The main task is to provide
  * a System object, which implement the {{{SystemProvider#System}}}
  * interface.
  *
  * System operations are related to the underlying operating
  * system and environment. The typical example would be an
  * `exit` function, that quits the game by doing the proper thing
  * on each system.
  *
  * The System abstraction should provide common and convenient task
  * that a game may need to do, but in a platform-independent way.
  * We should aim at providing only operations that are truly
  * cross-platform.
  *
  * The SystemProvider is a mandatory part of the game cake. It provides
  * The ResourcePath type which is used to identfiy all game resources
  * (audio files, bitmap files, general text-based data), hence most
  * other providers depend on it.
