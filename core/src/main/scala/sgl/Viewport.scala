  /** A screen view of the virtual world.
    *
    * Viewport is meant to map a virtual world into a physical screen. It
    * essentially exports a mapping between two coordinate systems. Given that
    * it's 2D, it's a relatively straightforward mapping (although it can still
    * help with things like scaling and stretching), but the class is
    * convenient as an abstraction of how to render the virtual world into the
    * screen, and is used by various components of the framework as a standard
    * way to express this mapping. For example, the [[sgl.scene]] extension
    * needs the notion of a viewport to properly map click events (on the
    * pixels on the screen) to the right world coordinates.
    *
    * The Viewport is instantiated with the width and height of the screen
    * where it should map the world to. In general, this should be the
    * Window.width and Window.height, but it doesn't have to be, it could be an
    * area of it (for split screens or minimaps by layering two Viewport on top
    * of each others).  The coordinates of the physical screen are discrete,
    * since the screen is made of individual pixels. The dimensions are the
    * number of pixels in both width and height.
    *
    * Once created, we need to set a camera, which represents the part the game
    * world that should be rendered into the viewport. It can be smaller or larger
    * than the viewport screen, and it might not have the same aspect ratio. The camera
    * should use a coordinate system that is convenient for describing your game.
    * You use [[Viewport.withViewport]] to prepare your canvas before rendering
    * your world. By setting up the camera, you can also explicitly query the
    * coordinates mapping from world to screen and screen to world. As the camera
    * coordinates are mutable, you can move it around depending on the state of the
    * game.
    *
    * If you don't set a camera, it defaults to the entire screen (top-left at
    * (0,0) with width and height equal to the screenWidth and heightWidth
    * parameters), providing a 1:1 mapping to the screen. The camera is defined
    * in floating point coordinates, as these are the world coordinates, and
    * they could be arbitrary (for example, the whole world could be defined
    * within [0,1] and the mapping to a physical viewport should do the rest).
    * The axis of the camera are the same as the underlying canvas axis.
    *
    * You can use the camera as the state of your scrolling implementation. If
    * you create a runner, and it moves horizontally all the time, you can simply
    * start with a camera at (0, 0, Window.width, Window.height), and each update
    * can increase the camera x coordinate. You can constantly query the viewport
    * for mapping your current world coordinates to the screen and render the
    * right part of world on the screen.
    *
    * You can also handle the camera yourself, in your virtual coordinate
    * system, and use the viewport just as a mapping from your virtual world
    * dimensions to the actual screen dimensions. An example of this is the
    * scene.ui.ScrollPane which maintain its own internal camera system for
    * scrolling, and is at a fixed coordinates. In that case, you would use the
    * viewport by mapping the physical size of the ScrollPane (not the virtual
    * scrolled world, but the actual paneWidth and paneHeight dimensions that
    * the pane occupies) to the screen coordinates, and the viewport camera
    * would never need to move (it would still need to be set to the dimensions
    * of the ScrollPane, but origin would stay (0,0)).
    * 
    * Finally, you can set the [[Viewport.scalingStrategy]], which is a
    * configuration of the mapping from world to screen. This lets you decide
    * if you want to stretch the world to fill the screen, to fit it by keeping
    * aspect ratio but at the cost of black borders, or to just do nothing and
    * map it 1:1. If not set, it defaults to NoScaling (1:1).
