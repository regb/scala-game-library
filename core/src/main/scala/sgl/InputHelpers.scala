  /** Provide current state of system Inputs
    *
    * This is an abstraction on top of the inputs provided by the
    * system. It's a global (to the cake) object as we consider inputs
    * are unique (you don't need to handle separate input providers) and
    * should be accessible to any part of the system.
    *
    * It must be kept up-to-date by processing each event as it arise. This
    * is the role of the InputHelpers.processEvent function. It is not called
    * automatically by the game loop, as we consider those helpers to be
    * optional to the system, but one way to ensure this is called is to collect
    * events in the game screen using the InputHelpers.pollEvent, which is the
    * equivalent to the Input.pollEvent but maintain the state as well.
    *
    * This is a superset of possible inputs, including
    * touch screen based (typically for mobile), mouse based, keyboards, etc.
    * It's mutable, but (ideally) should only be mutated by the input provider
    * backend implementation (TODO: try to enforce it with visibility declarations)
    * and is always up to date during a call to update.
    *
    * It exposes distinctly mouse and touch state, so if one
    * queries the state of the mouse like if it's down and its position, 
    * and the underlying platform is a touch based without a mouse, the
    * state of the mouse will not pretend to be a touch interface.
    *
    * The above design is to make sure to have perfect control, and to
    * design the best possible interface on each platform. To simplify
    * cross-platform programming, the Inputs also provides a PointingDevice
    * abstraction, which will expose any pointing-based input (mouse or touch)
    * as the same thing.
    *
    * Most state is expressed with the term "*Pressed". Pressed might be
    * a bit confusing since in Java we usually have down, up, and pressed
    * events, with pressed being fired only when up happens. But here, pressed
    * means the state is currently pressed (or down). A button/key can
    * be in a pressed state for many frames. Pressed was chosen as it sounded
    * better with some terms such as Buttons.leftPressed (versus leftDown, which
    * sounds like a direction).

      *
      * Note that, as for other states, this will not masquerade
      * stuff. So a leftPressed in only a mouse left button click,
      * and we won't set it if a single touch on the screen is for
      * example happening.
