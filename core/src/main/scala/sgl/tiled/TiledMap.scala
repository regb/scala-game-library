// TODO: not a big fan of having the dependency on the geometry package, it's not clear

//       there's a Point object defined in the TMX format, and another one (not imported here)
//       in the geometry package.
//       It might make sense to extract these functionalities into a PhysicsTiledMap class or

//       representation of the tiled map data.

/** A Scala representation of a TMX map.
  *
  * The role of this is to provide a lightweight Scala abstraction
  * on top of the TMX file format for tile maps (from the tiled editor).
  * It adds only a few convenient methods to manipulate the tilemap, and
  * mostly focus on mapping the representation of a TMX map to a typesafe
  * representation that is easily useable from Scala. Other methods such as
  * renderer can then be built on top. This class is mostly addressing the
  * syntax issue of manipulating a map stored in the TMX format, it tries
  * to avoid interpreting any of the semantics of the format, this is best
  * left to other classes that can work on the TiledMap.
  *
  * In parsing, the line is often blurry between syntax and semantics, so the
  * mapping from the raw TMX data to the TiledMap object might sometimes lose
  * data or transform the data a tiny bit to make it more convenient to use. One
  * example is how external tilesets and templates are embeded explicitly in this
  * representation and thus there's no way to map back to the original raw data.
  * This seems like an acceptable trade-off, as there's no concrete use cases today
  * for mapping from SGL back to the original TMX data.
  *
  * The point is not to abstract away low level information from tmx (that is
  * something that could be done with a Map interface somewhere else), but just
  * to provide a parser from textual representation to a Scala structure. Most
  * of the structure below are directly mapped from the official TMX format
  * documentation.
