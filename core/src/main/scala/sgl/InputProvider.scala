/*
 * The design of the input handling abstraction went through a few
 * unsatisfying trials. The original design was to have GameScreen
 * implementing a processInputs function, with an InputBUffer being
 * passed with the different inputs since the last update.
 *
 * There were several issues with that attempt. First, the distinction
 * between events (a key down/up/pressed) and state (is the key up or down)
 * was a bit confusing. An event is only fired for one frame, then disappear,
 * while the state can last several frames. Events need to be captured
 * right on the frame it happens.
 * Additionally, we need a way to check if an event has been consumed
 * by some entity. This would be typically used for HUD on top of game, if
 * the HUD intercept a click event, the underlying game screen should ignore
 * the event.
 *
 * The current design goal is to clearly separate events from state. State
 * can be provided as a global, always available, data structure. So it
 * should be provided directly in the InputProvider (but actually implemented
 * in the InputHelper) component, and could be queried at any time during update,
 * since there should not be any notion of who consumed the state first (unlike events).
 * State are typically whether a key is currently pressed or not, so it can remain
 * active for several frames. Events are one-off occurence, when the key is pressed
 * down and then nothing for several frames, until it is released, where there
 * would be another single event.

/** Provider for input handling 
  *
  * The core responsability of an InputProvider implementation is to collect
  * system events {InputEvent}, and expose them in the eventQueue. The InputProvider
  * only collects lowest level events, such as mouse down and up, and not derived
  * event such as mouse pressed (down + up in a given interval). It also distinguishes
  * each kind of device (mouse vs touch), and does not abstract one as the other. That
  * job can be performed by a layer on top. The design principles here is to expose the
  * real core of the events, and then build any simplification/abstraction as separate
  * modules on top. That seeems like a cleaner design, and will simplify the implementation
  * of input providers backends.
  *
  * The queue is not automatically cleaned, and events must be processed by invoking
  * Input.pollEvent that returns the first event in the queue. This is the GameScreen
  * responsability to collect and handle events on each update/frame, and if it does
  * not call pollEvent, then events will keep accumulating in the queue, which could lead
  * to delayed response to user input. That design seems better as, in case the game falls
  * behind in term of updating/rendering, it's better to let it decide how to handle
  * inputs that should have been handled a few frames ago (rather than just drop them from the
  * queue).
  *
  * The implementation of the input state is provided in another trait, the
  * InputHelpers, and is thus optional. It is a natural consequence of the above design,
  * as we do not want to necessarily force the handling of all events all the time, nor
  * the update of the global state. That layer is also a natural place for providing
  * higher-level events that require some buffering/history (another word for state),
  * such as tap (touch down and up, with a reasonable time in between) and scroll events.

      * accumulate in the eventQueue until explicitly processed by
      * pollEvent() or processEvents(). The eventProcessor can be set
      * so that the Input module automatically calls it on every event.
      *
      * Depending on the value of ProcessInputsDuringUpdate, the processor code
      * will be invoked synchronously on the event (if false), or
      * asynchronously on the event during the next loop iteration (if true).
      * If the processing is delayed to the next loop update, all the events
      * will automatically be processed, in the order of arrival, just before
      * the framework invokes the update() call.
      *
      * The difference when executed synchronously is that this is called
      * in the same callback/thread as the event happening. Processing
      * done here will be immediately effective in response to the
      * event, but that also means it will happen outside an update-render
      * loop cycle. This can be particularly useful if you target javascript,
      * because browsers tend to require that some actions (opening links,
      * playing music) happen in the same callback as the event, and
      * using the eventQueue model to process events in batch does not actually
      * work well with that requirements (the action happens in a different
      * callstack than the user event).
      *
      * This has the drawback of course that these callbacks might end up racing
      * with a loop update call. So either you need to disable the
      * ProcessInputsDuringUpdate (most platforms set it to false by default), or
      * you need to be aware of the potential races. It is not an issue on the web,
      * because there's no multithreading, and thus this is a platform where this
      * would be enabled by default.
