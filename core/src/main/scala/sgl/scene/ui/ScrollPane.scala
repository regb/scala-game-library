  /** A scrollable pane to hold SceneNodes.
    *
    * This is a SceneNode that can be part of a SceneGraph. It has an initial
    * position (_x, _y), and will always occupy paneWidth and paneHeight
    * dimensions within that container. The worldWidth and worldHeight are the
    * inner dimensions available to hold SceneNodes. It initially shows the
    * portion of the visible world at the point (0,0) (top left camera).
    *
    * The ScrollPane is flexible in the sense that the paneWidth/paneHeight
    * do not need to match the screen dimensions, and thus it can be used
    * as part of a mosaic of other panes. If for some reason the worldWidth or
    * worldHeight is smaller than the paneWidth/paneHeight, the pane will
    * still behave (from its parent point of view) as if it was using the
    * paneWidth/paneHeight dimensions (it won't need scrolling and it will
    * show its child nodes starting from the top left corner).
    *
    * A pane is a sort of transparent rectangular layer, so even if none of its
    * nodes captures an event, the pane itself will interecept it and notify
    * the event. This is by opposition to a SceneGroup which also behave as some
    * sort of nodes container, but will not interecept events outside the nodes.
    *
    * A ScrollPane handles events and forward them to their elements according to
    * the following rules. It first tries to intercept any scrolling action and
    * only apply it to itself without forwarding it below. That means that the down/moved/up
    * sequence of events that could potentially touch a node in the pane will never
    * be seen by that node. However, when the action does not look like a scrolling
    * move, it will send the pointer down, pointer up, and potentially click event to
    * the selected node. This procedures involves a good deal of estimation, because
    * the first step of a scroll involve a down event and the last step involve an up
    * event. To handle that, the ScrollPane will delay the initial down event and determine
    * if this is a scroll or not, and if it so, it will never forward the down event. However,
    * if the player does not start scrolling right away (within a few 10s of ms), then the
    * down event will be sent to the node. At this point, the player might start scrolling
    * anyway, which will be interpreted as a loss of focus for the selected node, which
    * will be sent an up event (event though there was no actual up event from the player).
    * There will also not be any click event there, the intent being that the node gets a
    * down event to update its state (display a pressed state), then an up event to reset its
    * state, but no click event so no action taken. If the player does a regular click action,
    * the sequence on the selected node will be down-up-click, and an action can be taken
    * on the click event.
    *
    * Nodes contained in the ScrollPane should thus expect to see down and up events, and
    * potentially no click event afterwards. The up event should be seen as the cancel
    * of the down event. The node could also see a sequence of down-pointerleave, without
    * an up event. An up event does not literally means that the player lifted the pointer.
