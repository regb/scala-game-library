// This package contains only the implementation of the core game engine. The
// goal is to be able to add as few dependencies (no firebase or google play)
// as necessary.  Besides being just the right thing to do, this started as a
// way to try to make sure nothing was collecting the Android Advertising ID,
// which Google somehow kept complaining about in my games, even though I only
// use their own library and explicitly disabled any collection (and not even
// use the analytics of advertising parts of the packages).  But it seems that
// just by having the libraries packaged, we are asking for trouble, so this
// split will go the extra mile.

// Notice that the name is sgl-android-core, and
// it depends on sgl-core-android. The naming convention is that sgl-core is
// the abstract interface, sgl-core-android is the abstract interface compiled
// for the Android platform, and sgl-android-core is the android implementaiton
// of the abstract core.
